Oh no! Another audio message that i can't/want to listen...
No problem! Foward it to [AntiTalk_bot](https://telegram.me/AntiTalk_bot) and read a transcription powered by Wit, Google, Microsoft and other services!

This bot also work with Whatsapp, just share the audio with Telegram and then select AntiTalk_bot from your contant list, is that easy!

### Our goals for this project:
- Simple, free and easy to use transcription bot, just send the audio and get the response.
- Clean and easy to extend codebase, do you want to add other transcription services ? Just implement the "transcription" interface, we take care of the rest.
- Less dependencies as possible.

### Dependencies:
- Opus-tools

### I want this on my server
Just create a PARAM.class file following the PARAM_example.class structure, compile and run the .jar

### What's being worked on now
- Codebase refactoring
- Some sort of work-balancing for all the transcription services and keys
- Better error handling
- Better anonymous statistics

### Contribution
